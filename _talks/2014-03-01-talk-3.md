Acquiring a language requires learners to differentiate sound categories. First language acquisition likely uses a form of unsupervised learning, where infants use the statistics of the input to identify categories. However, in second language acquisition, category learning is considered a supervised (feedback-driven) process. It is unclear how these relate. This study examined the combined effects of unsupervised and supervised learning on auditory category learning. Participants (n=165) learned categories that consisted of two-tone complexes, where frequency of the tone was the critical feature. Participants completed a passive listening (unsupervised) phase with randomly generated exemplars from two clusters in an acoustic space. They then underwent a 2AFC supervised phase where the reinforced boundary either matched or mismatched the unsupervised phase. Results show stronger learning (higher accuracy) when boundaries in the supervised phase matched the unsupervised (p = 0.0407). This did not interact with whether boundaries spanned one or two dimensions.
