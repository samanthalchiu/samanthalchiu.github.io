The phrase "caught in the heat of the moment" is widely used to describe how temporary emotional states can influence cognition such as response inhibition, stopping a preprogrammed response. The ongoing debate on the specifics of this interaction, however, presents unclear findings. Neurological research suggests that affective states induce lateralized frontal asymmetries but has left a gap on the effect of emotional asymmetries on inhibition. This study looks to predict inhibition accuracy and ERPs in a Go/Nogo task using brain lateralization patterns during affective states through EEG and ERP data. Thirty-four participants (Mage 18-25) were recruited. Participants completed personality measures and were fitted with a 128-channel Electrical Geodesics cap and headphones. A resting baseline, emotion induction via a happy (“Seinfeld”) or sad (“The Champ”) film clip, Go/No-Go inhibition task, second baseline and emotion manipulation check were recorded. We hypothesize that sadness will induce a right-hemispheric asymmetry, improve inhibition accuracy, and enhance Nogo (inhibition) ERP amplitudes.
